        This is just a small project to get the names of areas in Lusaka. I
        needed to compile a list in a database and this is the easiest way I
        could think of getting that list.
      heading: Areas of Lusaka
    form:
      label: Area Name
      placeholder: Enter an area
      button: Submit
  areas:
    heading: List of Areas in Lusaka
    loaded:
      title: Successful Load
      text: Areas loaded successfully!
    added:
      text: "{area} added to the list!"
    error:
      title: Error
      duplicate:
        title: Duplicate Area
        text: The area has already been added!
  no_areas:
    heading: No areas
    description: Get started by adding a new area.
